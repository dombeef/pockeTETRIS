# pockeTETRIS
This project originally was meant as a fathers day gift for my tetris-loving father, and I felt like it should be available for others if they want to make a pretty small tetris clone. This was the smallest I could make it with a big enough battery and a thick durable 3d printed housing.

I modified tetris code created by Andy Jackson to be used with 3 buttons, since his original code was made for the AttinyArcade platform that has 2 buttons.
